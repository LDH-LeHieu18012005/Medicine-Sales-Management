This is my first project in the field of web design, focusing on a sales management system, specifically managing the processes of adding, editing, and deleting pharmaceutical sales. The user-friendly interface aims to provide the best possible user experience. Currently, I have only completed the basic main interface, including the login page, registration page, and contact information page. In the future, I will continue to work hard to further improve my product. There are still many shortcomings in this project, and I look forward to receiving feedback to help me make continuous improvements.
